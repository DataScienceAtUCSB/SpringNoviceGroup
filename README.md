# SpringNoviceGroup
Project outlines for the club's novice project group


<h1>Data Science at UCSB</h1>

<p>
	Welcome to the novice project group! I hope you are excited. The best way to learn these skills is to apply them to a project. Besides that, we hope that you will learn some basic teamwork and delegation skills along the way. It is important that you are honest about what you do and do not know. "Fake it 'till you make it" won't work here... and neither will your code! 
</p>

<p>
	Jason will be in this room every meeting to act as a friendly resource for questions and guidance. He will not give lectures or walk you through step-by-step. There are three project outlines, one of each on data visualization, web scraping, and basic machine learning. If you have a different idea for a project, there will be a time during the first meeting to pitch your idea and recruit group members.
</p>

<h3>Rules</h3>
<ul>
	<li>
		You are not allowed to do homework in this room

			<li>
				The webscraping project is designed for Python
